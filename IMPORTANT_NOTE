I HAVE ADDED ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY LIKE STYLING, SHOWING VIDEO, AUTHTICATION, RERIRECTION TO ANOTHER VIDEO.

BUT WHEN YOU CLICK ON SEARCH BUTTON IT WON'T WORK, ALTHOUGH IT TAKES THE DATA FROM THE INPUT TAG, BUT IT API WON'T WORK OVER THERE. 

I ALSO HAVE TO WORK ON THE WATCHING PAGE, IN THAT WHEN I CLICK ON ANY VIDEO IT IS NOT PLAYING ON THE IN THE IFRAME.

SO BASCIALLY WE HAVE TO MAKE TWO THING, THAT ARE LEFT ALONG WITH THE RESPONSIVENESS.....

OTHER WISE EVERYTHING IS DONE....
